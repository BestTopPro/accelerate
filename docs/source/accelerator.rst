Accelerator
=======================================================================================================================

The :class:`~accelerate.Accelerator` is the main class provided by ðŸ¤— Accelerate. It serves at the main entrypoint for
the API. To quickly adapt your script to work on any kind of setup with ðŸ¤— Accelerate juste:

1. Initialize an :class:`~accelerate.Accelerator` object (that we will call :obj:`accelerator` in the rest of this
   page) as early as possible in your script.
2. Pass along your model(s), optimizer(s), dataloader(s) to the :meth:`~accelerate.Accelerator.prepare` method.
3. (Optional but best practice) Remove all the :obj:`.cuda()` or :obj:`.to(device)` in your code and let the
   :obj:`accelerator` handle device placement for you.
4. Replace the :obj:`loss.backward()` in your code by :obj:`accelerator.backward(loss)`.
5. (Optional, when using distributed evaluation) Gather your predictions and labelsbefore storing them or using them
   for metric computation using :meth:`~accelerate.Accelerator.gather`.

This is all what is needed in most cases. For more advanced case or a nicer experience here are the functions you
should search for and replace by the corresponding methods of your :obj:`accelerator`:

- :obj:`print` statements should be replaced by :meth:`~accelerate.Accelerator.print` to be only printed once per
  process.
- Use :meth:`~accelerate.Accelerator.is_local_main_process` for statements that should be executed once per server.
- Use :meth:`~accelerate.Accelerator.is_main_process` for statements that should be executed once only.
- Use :meth:`~accelerate.Accelerator.wait_for_everyone` to make sure all processes join that point before continuing
  (useful before a model save for instance).
- Use :meth:`~accelerate.Accelerator.unwrap_model` to unwrap your model before saving it.
- Use :meth:`~accelerate.Accelerator.save` instead of :obj:`torch.save`.
- Use :meth:`~accelerate.Accelerator.clip_grad_norm_` instead of :obj:`torch.nn.utils.clip_grad_norm_` and
  :meth:`~accelerate.Accelerator.clip_grad_value_` instead of :obj:`torch.nn.utils.clip_grad_value_`.
